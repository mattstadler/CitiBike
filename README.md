# CitiBike

## Overview
-The purpose of this project is to analyze Citi Bike data in New York City to evaluable the viability of a similar business in another city.

## Results
- The following 5 observations can be made from the visualizations:
  - Trip durations tend to peak between 3 and 8 hours
  - Males use bikes at about a 4-fold rate vs. Females
  - During the workweek, rides are most common during the morning and evening commutes; during the weekend, rides are most common midday
  - Males use bikes more frequently than females and the distribution by among in each gender group is about the same
  - Both males and females tend to use bikes more often durin the workweek
- *supporting images and Tableau story included in repo*

## Summary
- Overall, Males use bikes much more frequently than Females, and bike usage follows a predictable pattern - peaks during the workweek commutes and leisure rides during the weekends. 
- Two additional visualizations could include 1) current communiting patterns in the target city by gender (to ensure adequate demand), and 2) activity levels in the target city (to see if people commute to work).
